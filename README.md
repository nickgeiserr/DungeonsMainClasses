# DungeonsMainClasses
Main classes of Minecraft Dungeons

This is a Header file containing a lot of references to objects in Minecraft : Dungeons

This can be used with the BP Loader - https://www.nexusmods.com/minecraftdungeons/mods/111?tab=files&file_id=186 - Developed by CCCode.

It will allow you to reference game objects when creating blueprints allowing for more powerful and easier Modding.

# UPDATES

In case of a Update for the game this File will be outdated. Things may have changed and you may not be able to do certain things or load certain levels. 

It will usually take me up to 1-2 Days to fully update the file.
